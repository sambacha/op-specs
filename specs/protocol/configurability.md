When deploying the OP Stack software to a production environment,
certain parameters about the protocol can be configured. These
configurations can include a variety of parameters which affect the
resulting properties of the blockspace in question.

There are three categories of OP Stack configuration options:

- **Protocol Parameters**: Parameters and properties of the chain that may
  be set at genesis and fixed for the lifetime of the chain, or may be
  changeable through a privileged account.
- **Admin Roles**: These roles can upgrade contracts, change role owners,
  or update protocol parameters. These are typically cold/multisig wallets not
  used directly in day to day operations.
- **Service Roles**: These roles are used to manage the day-to-day
  operations of the chain, and therefore are often hot wallets.
